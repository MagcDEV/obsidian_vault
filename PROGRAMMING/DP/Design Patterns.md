Are design level solutions for recurring problems that we software engineers come across often. They are not code, but rather template or descriptions of how to solve a problem in reusable way. Design patterns can help us write more readable, maintainable, and adaptable code. There are three types of design patterns creational, structural, and behavioral.

- Creational patterns deal with class instantiation and object creation. They provide different ways to create objects, such as using a factory method, a singleton, or a prototype.
- Structural patterns deal with the structure and composition of classes and objects. they provide different ways to organize and combine objects, such as using an adapter, a bridge, or a composite.
- Behavioral patterns deal with the communication and interaction between classes and objects. They provide different ways to define the behavior and responsibilities of objects, such as using a strategy, an observer , or a command.

This are some of the most important design patterns:

- [[MVC]]
- [[Repository]]
- [[Observer]]
- [[Decorator]]
- [[CQRS]]
- [[Singleton]]
- [[Factory]]
- [[Prototype]]
- [[Strategy]]
- [[Command]]
