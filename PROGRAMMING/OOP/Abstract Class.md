Is a class that can not be instantiated, but can be subclassed by another class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods, constructors, static methods, and final methods. It can also be used for inner classes and outer classes.

A class that implements an abstract class must provide the implementation for all the abstract methods in the abstract class. The purpose of an abstract class is to achieve data [[Abstraction]], which is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the use. An abstract class can also act as a contract that guarantees that any class that implements it will have the methods that are defined in the abstract class. This allows the code to be more flexible and reusable, and reduces the coupling between classes.
