***
A subclass should be substitutable for its superclass. This means that any object of the superclass can be replaced by an object of the subclass without breaking the functionality of the program. This can be ensured by following certain rules, such as not violating the contract of the superclass, not reducing the preconditions or increasing the postconditions of the methods, and not introducing new exceptions. For example, a class that represents a rectangle can be a subclass of a class that represents a quadrilateral, but not a subclass of a class that represents a square, because a square has more constraints than a rectangle.
