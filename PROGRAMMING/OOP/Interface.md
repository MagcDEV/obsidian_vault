An interface defines the behavior and properties of a class without specifying its implementation. It is a way  of abstracting ([[Abstraction]]) and encapsulating ([[Encapsulation]]) the functionality of a class, and allowing multiple classes to share the same interface. An interface can also be used as a type, and enable polymorphism ([[Polymorphism]]), which means that different classes can be treated in the same way as long as they implement the same interface.
